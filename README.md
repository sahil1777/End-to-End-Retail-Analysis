# Comprehensive Analysis of E-Commerce Data: Business Insights through Multi-Level Querying

## Project Overview

- This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow, starting from data extraction to deriving meaningful insights from e-commerce data using Python and PostgreSQL. It showcases how multi-level querying—ranging from descriptive to predictive analytics—can address real-world business challenges and generate actionable insights. The project integrates data engineering and analytical techniques, leveraging SQL querying within Python to perform complex analyses and present insights using visualizations.

- Key Components:
  - Data Extraction & Loading: Extracting raw data and loading it into a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
  - SQL Querying in Python: Employing SQL queries in Python to perform various levels of analysis, from descriptive customer and sales metrics to predictive and prescriptive business insights.
  - Data Visualization: Visualizing key findings to enhance decision-making and provide stakeholders with clear insights.

- File Components:
  - dump_data.ipynb:
    - A Jupyter Notebook script that dumps raw CSV file records into a PostgreSQL database. This script handles the initial data loading process for further analysis.
  - Data_dump.pdf:
    - A PDF version of the dump_data.ipynb notebook, providing a static reference for the data loading process into PostgreSQL.
  - main_analysis.ipynb:
    - A Jupyter Notebook where the primary analysis is performed. This includes multi-level SQL querying and data analysis, covering descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to derive actionable business insights.
  - Analysis.pdf:
    - A PDF version of the main_analysis.ipynb notebook, offering a static view of the analytical process, visualizations, and insights.
